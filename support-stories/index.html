  <h1>Support Stories</h1>
      <p>Support Stories brings together Customer Support professionals from a range of startups across London to share their insights and to learn from one another in a valuable way.</p>

      <p>Our community aims to discuss the challenges encountered whilst performing the role of Support in an attempt to help others who may be facing similar difficulties. We also share the communities successes via our email chain and over Slack. Moreover, we hold quarterly breakfast events showcasing experienced speakers and we organise coffee roulette to ensure communications and networking continues in between events.</p>

      <p>As a community we’re growing rapidly, with 50+ people attending our breakfast events making these events highly valuable as our members contribute & share their experiences. If you’d like to recommend someone to join Support Stories, you can do so here.</p>

      <p>The group is run by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiefitzpatrick/">Sophie Fitzpatrick</a>, Tianna Chan, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelfranklinqub/">Rachel Franklin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-macgregor-29760aa7/">Emma MacGregor</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/freddie-blunt-32b48667/">Freddie Blunt</a> and is made all the more valuable by our members.

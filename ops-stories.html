          <h2>Who are we?</h2>

          <p>The community for operations folks in startups and scaleups.</p>

          <p>
            Started in March 2018, we are now 200+ people with “Operations” in
            our titles. We learn from each other by discussing challenges and
            sharing stories, experiences, and advice. Most importantly, we help
            each other be more effective and grow in our roles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ops Stories is your space to share experience and advice, ask/answer
            questions, grow professionally and expand your network online and
            offline.
          </p>

          <h2>Where are we?</h2>

          <p>
            Most of our members are in London, UK but the world is our oyster
            &#128578; and we reach as far as the USA, Spain, The Netherlands,
            Lithuania, Malaysia and Australia.
          </p>

          <h2>Who runs Ops Stories?</h2>

          <p>
            Ops Stories was created in March 2018 by
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ausrine/" target="_blank"
              >Aušrinė Keršanskaitė</a

            >
            (Co-Founders @ Operations Nation) because we have a big passion for
            ops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing people thrive in their roles and achieve efficiency for their
            companies is what motivates us to keep giving 100% to the community
            and its growth. We want to keep it relevant so “quality over
            quantity” is our motto every step of the way.

          <h2>How does Ops Stories community work?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We communicate over Slack (mainly) and Google Groups
              (occasionally).
            </li>
            <li>
              Our backbone are the roundtables that are facilitated by our
              members.
            </li>
            <li>
              We share any relevant notes taken during our events for future
              reference.
            </li>
            <li>
              We support our member-led initiatives. That’s how Ops Stories Book
              Club and
              <a href="https://medium.com/opsstories" target="_blank"
                >Ops Stories Blog</a
              >
              were born, and many member-led roundtables organised.
            </li>
            <li>
              We organise informal socials and encourage 1-2-1s to ensure that
              everyone gets to know each other and promote open conversations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What do we expect from our members?</h2>

          <p>
            Ops Stories members make the community greater than the sum of its
            parts when they actively engage in conversation and help each other!
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Attend</b> the occasional social. Getting to know the other
              members will allow you to get more out of the community on a
              personal and professional level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Suggest</b> a roundtable topic. Each conversation is beneficial
              to all of our members. Don’t be shy and speak up, we’ll help you
              organise it. You don’t need to be the subject expert, just bring
              the questions to fuel the conversation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Connect</b> with people. Set up a 1-2-1 to discuss common
              challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Respect</b> each other. Everyone is at a different stage of
              their ops career, but no question is more or less valuable.
              Sharing knowledge and paying it forward is how we can make ops
              shine in all companies, not just our own.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Commit</b> to being part of this community. <b>Value</b> that
              you’re a part of a group of likeminded people and don’t forget to
              <b>give back</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Don’t</b> indulge in self-promotion.</li>
          </ul>

          <b>Big Thanks</b>

          <p>
            Finally, we want to give a big shout out to COO Stories, the first
            Stories community. Their support has allowed Ops Stories to get to
            where we are now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, Ops Stories wouldn’t be what it is without our members. They
            inspire us as organisers to do better, push forward, and grow in the
            best way possible. Seeing that Ops Stories is an asset in their
            professional development is all we need to keep going.

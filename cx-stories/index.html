  <h1>CX Stories</h1>
      <p>The goal of CX Stories is to bring together people in Customer Experience (CX) and Customer Success (CS) leadership roles to share their thoughts and experience, specifically around working in high growth companies.</p>

      <p>There will be an intimate breakfast meet-up approximately every 6 weeks to discuss one topic in particular, as well as an email list and slack channel where questions can be raised and answered by the community.</p>

      <p>Our Customer Experience community is run by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstymacdonald8/" target="_blank">Kirsty MacDonald</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianagraycxm/" target="_blank">Diana Gray</a>; and made indispensable by all those who attend our meet-ups and contribute to the on-going discussion.</p>

      <p>We love to welcome new voices and faces, so if you have someone you’d like to recommend, you can do so here.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to get in touch about anything else; email: <a href="mailto:cxstories@coostories.com">cxstories@coostories.com</a>.</p>
